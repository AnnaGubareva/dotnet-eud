Click a gray area around the design surface to select a report.

You can use smart tags to access the most commonly used element properties. Smart tags are available for most report controls, bands and a report itself.

Smart tags can also contain context links that enable you to perform various actions.

When you select a report control of specific type, the [Toolbox](../../report-designer-tools/toolbox.md) provides the corresponding contextual tab. This tab allows you to specify settings and perform actions applicable to the selected element's type.

You can use the Property Grid to access the whole set of settings that the selected element supports.
