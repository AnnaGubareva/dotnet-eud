# Save Reports

When you save a report, a file with the REPX extension is created. This file stores information about the report layout.

You can use one of the following commands to save reports:

## Use the Ribbon's Home Tab

* Click **Save** and the **Save as** to save your report's copy.

	Specify a folder and file name in the invoked standard **Save** dialog.

* Click **Save** or press CTRL+S to save the report's layout in the application's folder.
