# Access Report Element Settings

You can select a report control or band and click its smart tag to access the most commonly used properties.

Smart tags are available for most report controls, bands and a report itself. To select a report, click the gray area around the design surface.

Smart tags can also contain context links that enable you to perform various actions.

When you select a report control of specific type, the [Toolbox](../../report-designer-tools/toolbox.md) provides the corresponding contextual tab. This tab allows you to specify settings and perform actions applicable to the selected element's type.

You can use the Property Grid to access the whole set of settings that the selected element supports.
