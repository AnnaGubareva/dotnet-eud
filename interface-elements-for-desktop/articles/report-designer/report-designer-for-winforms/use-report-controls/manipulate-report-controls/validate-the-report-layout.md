# Validate the Report Layout

Your report layout should meet the following requirements to be correctly printed and exported to specific formats:

* **Avoid intersecting controls**
	
	The Report Designer highlights intersecting report controls to warn you that the report layout can be corrupted on export to specific formats.
	
	Disable the **Export Warnings** option in the toolbar to ignore this rule and do not highlight intersecting controls. 

* **Do not place controls outside page margins**
	
	The Report Designer highlights report controls that do not fit into the printable page area and overrun the right page margin. This warns you that extra pages can appear when document is printed.
	
    Disable the **Printing Warnings** option in the toolbar to hide these warnings.
